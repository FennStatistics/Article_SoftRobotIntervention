 # Online study files

Contains the study files of all studies: 

* [translation process](https://github.com/FennStatistics/Article_SoftRobotIntervention/tree/main/Materials/translation%20process) - before the main study was conducted in a blinded backtranslation process the applyied survey scales were translated
* [scenario text](https://github.com/FennStatistics/Article_SoftRobotIntervention/tree/main/Materials/scenario%20text) - the scenario texts of the (i) socially assistive robots and (ii) rescue robots in English (two files separately for each robot) and German (one file for robots combined)
    * the scenario texts were informed by the expert survey of the world cafe, for details please see [expert survey](https://github.com/FennStatistics/Article_SoftRobotIntervention/tree/main/Materials/scenario%20text/expert%20survey%20(world%20cafe))
* [coding guidelines](https://github.com/FennStatistics/Article_SoftRobotIntervention/tree/main/Materials/coding%20guidelines) - the semantic content of the drawn Cognitive-Affective Maps was summarized by means of a qualitative content analyses, whereby the coding guidelines were created and applied in 4 distinct steps:
    1. **initial evaluation of coding guidelines**: four (OR FIVE OR SIX!!!???) distinct raters applied the first version of the coding guidelines to X% of the words to test for inter-rater reliability
    2. **discussing initial coding guidelines**: the coding guidelines were discussed (see protocol of team discussion)
    3. **adjustement of coding guidelines**: based on 2. and further discussion between two main authors the coding guidelines were respectively adjusted
    4. **applying coding guidelines**: the final coding guidelines were applied by seven raters to the complete data set, whereby X% percent of words were overlapping to test for inter-rater reliability
        + finally the ratings were slightly adjusted by the two main authors, because of X
