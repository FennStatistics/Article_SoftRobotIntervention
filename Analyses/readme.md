- [Part I](https://github.com/FennStatistics/Article_BasalAttributes/tree/main/Analyses/part_I): Generated a list of 32 basal attributes based on expert interviews and existing literature.
- [Part II](https://github.com/FennStatistics/Article_BasalAttributes/tree/main/Analyses/part_II): Laypersons cognitively and emotionally evaluated these attributes, forming clusters of semantically related basal attributes.
- [Part III](https://github.com/FennStatistics/Article_BasalAttributes/tree/main/Analyses/part_III): Employed ChatGPT to systematically generate text about future material systems using identified clusters. These texts were evaluated by both experts and laypersons.
