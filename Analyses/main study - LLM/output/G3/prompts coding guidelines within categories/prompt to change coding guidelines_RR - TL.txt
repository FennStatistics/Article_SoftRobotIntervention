### Task Overview
Your task is to update an existing coding guideline represented as a JSON object. Each key in the object corresponds to a specific code, and its value describes that code. You will perform one or more of the following operations: modifying descriptions, removing irrelevant codes, or adding new ones.

---

### Background Information
This coding guideline is part of a research project exploring people's perceptions of robots. Participants evaluated two types of robots: **traditional rigid robots** and **soft, electronic-free robots**. Feedback was collected using scenario-based descriptions of these robots, focusing on their **perceived risks** and **benefits**. The codes in this guideline address the **perceived technological limitations** specifically regarding **rescue robots**.

---

### Available Operations
- **Change**: Revise the description of an existing code for clarity, accuracy, or to reflect updated definitions.  
- **Delete**: Remove codes that are redundant, irrelevant, or no longer applicable.  
- **Add**: Introduce new codes to capture additional themes or concepts.  

---

### Data Structure
The guideline is structured as a JSON object under the key `code_descriptions`. Each key represents a code, and its value is a description of that code. Example structure:  
```json
{
  "code_descriptions": {
    "code_name_1": "Description of code_name_1.",
    "code_name_2": "Description of code_name_2."
  }
}
```

### Instructions for Applying Changes
Each update is written as a separate paragraph and follow these formats:  

- **Change**: Specify the operation as "Change" and include the code name. Provide a list of necessary changes in this format:  
   `[change1, change2, change3]`  
   Example:  
   `Change: "code_name_1". Updates: [clarify benefits, remove ambiguity].`  

- **Delete**: Specify the operation as "Delete" and include the code name. Provide the reason for deletion in this format:  
   `[reason for deletion]`  
   Example:  
   `Delete: "code_name_3". Reason: [redundant with code_name_2].`  

- **Add**: Specify the operation as "Add" and include a new code name. Provide the description using relevant keywords in this format:  
   `[keyword1, keyword2, keyword3]`  
   Example:  
   `Add: "code_name_4". Keywords: [safety, trust, autonomy].`

- Change: "limited autonomy". Updates: [Condense the description to focus on the main arguments, removing unnecessary details and the literal quote ("\n\n***") for clarity and conciseness.].
- Change: "faulty analyses". Updates: [Condense the description to focus on the main arguments, removing unnecessary details and the literal quote ("\n\n***") for clarity and conciseness.].
- Change: "speed comparison". Updates: [Condense the description to focus on the main arguments, removing unnecessary details and the literal quote ("\n\n***") for clarity and conciseness.].
- Change: "damage not excludable". Updates: [Condense the description to focus on the main arguments, removing unnecessary details and the literal quote ("\n\n***") for clarity and conciseness.].


- Change: "specialization". Updates: [add that specialization limits the robots' adaptability to diverse rescue scenarios].
- Change: "operational delay". Updates: [incorporate battery and recharging issues].
- Change: "faulty analyses". Updates: [add the importance of human oversight to avoid errors].
- Change: "robot runtime". Updates: [add energy constraints].
- Change: "damage not excludable". Updates: [add that soft/ non-durable materials could be damaged quickly].


- Change: "error risk". Updates: [incoporate all the arguments of "error-free"; add that errors can stem from both software and hardware issues; add algorithmic errors].
- Delete: "error-free". Reason: [same as "error risk"]. 

- Delete: "technological limitations". Reason: [code is too broad.]. 
- Delete: "perceived technological limitations". Reason: [code is too broad.]. 

 
- Add: "immature technology". Keywords: [highlights the developmental limitations of current rescue robot technology, emphasizing the lack of readiness for efficient real-world application]. 
- Add: "limited flexibility". Keywords: [highlights the robots' inability to adapt dynamically to unforeseen or complex situations].
