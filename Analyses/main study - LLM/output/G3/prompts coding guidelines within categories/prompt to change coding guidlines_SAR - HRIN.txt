### Task Overview
Your task is to update an existing coding guideline represented as a JSON object. Each key in the object corresponds to a specific code, and its value describes that code. You will perform one or more of the following operations: modifying descriptions, removing irrelevant codes, or adding new ones.

---

### Background Information
This coding guideline is part of a research project exploring people's perceptions of robots. Participants evaluated two types of robots: **traditional rigid robots** and **soft, electronic-free robots**. Feedback was collected using scenario-based descriptions of these robots, focusing on their **perceived risks** and **benefits**. The codes in this guideline address the **perceived negative Human-Robot-Interaction** specifically regarding **socially assistive robots**.

---

### Available Operations
- **Change**: Revise the description of an existing code for clarity, accuracy, or to reflect updated definitions.  
- **Delete**: Remove codes that are redundant, irrelevant, or no longer applicable.  
- **Add**: Introduce new codes to capture additional themes or concepts.  

---

### Data Structure
The guideline is structured as a JSON object under the key code_descriptions. Each key represents a code, and its value is a description of that code. Example structure:  
json
{
  "code_descriptions": {
    "code_name_1": "Description of code_name_1.",
    "code_name_2": "Description of code_name_2."
  }
}


---

### Instructions for Applying Changes
Each update is written as a separate paragraph and follow these formats:  

- **Change**: Specify the operation as "Change" and include the code name. Provide a list of necessary changes in this format:  
   [change1, change2, change3]  
   Example:  
   Change: "code_name_1". Updates: [clarify benefits, remove ambiguity].  

- **Delete**: Specify the operation as "Delete" and include the code name. Provide the reason for deletion in this format:  
   [reason for deletion]  
   Example:  
   Delete: "code_name_3". Reason: [redundant with code_name_2].  

- **Add**: Specify the operation as "Add" and include a new code name. Provide the description using relevant keywords in this format:  
   [keyword1, keyword2, keyword3]  
   Example:  
   Add: "code_name_4". Keywords: [safety, trust, autonomy].

### Necessary Changes

- Change: "loss of gestures". Updates: [condense the description to focus on the main arguments, removing unnecessary details and the literal quote ("\n\n*** \n\n") for clarity and conciseness].  
- Change: "emotional understanding". Updates: [condense the description to focus on the main arguments, removing unnecessary details and the literal quote ("\n\n*** \n\n") for clarity and conciseness].  
- Change: "individual response". Updates: [condense the description to focus on the main arguments, removing unnecessary details and the literal quote ("\n\n*** \n\n") for clarity and conciseness]. 
- Change: "impersonal". Updates: [condense the description to focus on the main arguments, removing unnecessary details and the literal quote ("\n\n*** \n\n") for clarity and conciseness].  
- Change: "dependence". Updates: [condense the description to focus on the main arguments, removing unnecessary details and the literal quote ("\n\n*** \n\n") for clarity and conciseness].
- Change: "emotional dependence". Updates: [add arguments for emotional replacement and arguments for emotional blunting and pseudo-relationships].  
- Change: "technical knowledge". Updates: [add arguments for communication barrier; condense the description to focus on the main arguments, removing unnecessary details and the literal quote ("\n\n*** \n\n") for clarity and conciseness].
- Change: "lack of humanity". Updates: [condense the description to focus on the main arguments, removing unnecessary details and the literal quote ("\n\n*** \n\n") for clarity and conciseness].
 

- Delete: "The animal-like shape leads to fewer associations with human counterpart". Reason: [same as "emotional support"].
- Delete: "perceived negative HRI". Reason: [same as "superficial interaction"].
- Delete: "older adults". Reason: [same as "fear"].
- Delete: "dementia patients". Reason: [same as "fear"].
- Delete: "emotional connection". Reason: [same as "emotional dependence"].
- Delete: "emotional replacement". Reason: [same as "emotional dependence"].
- Delete: "lack of insight". Reason: [same as "emotional understanding"].



- Add: "superficial interaction". Keywords: [concerns that robot interactions may feel insincere or lack depth compared to human connections].
