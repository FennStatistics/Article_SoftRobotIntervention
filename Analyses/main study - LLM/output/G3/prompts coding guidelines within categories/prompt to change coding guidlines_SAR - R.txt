### Task Overview
Your task is to update an existing coding guideline represented as a JSON object. Each key in the object corresponds to a specific code, and its value describes that code. You will perform one or more of the following operations: modifying descriptions, removing irrelevant codes, or adding new ones.

### Background Information
This coding guideline is part of a research project exploring people's perceptions of robots. Participants evaluated two types of robots: **traditional rigid robots** and **soft, electronic-free robots**. Feedback was collected using scenario-based descriptions of these robots, focusing on their **perceived risks** and **benefits**. The codes in this guideline address the **perceived risks** specifically regarding **socially assistive robots**.

---

### Available Operations
- **Change**: Revise the description of an existing code for clarity, accuracy, or to reflect updated definitions.  
- **Delete**: Remove codes that are redundant, irrelevant, or no longer applicable.  
- **Add**: Introduce new codes to capture additional themes or concepts.  

---

### Data Structure
The guideline is structured as a JSON object under the key code_descriptions. Each key represents a code, and its value is a description of that code. Example structure:  
json
{
  "code_descriptions": {
    "code_name_1": "Description of code_name_1.",
    "code_name_2": "Description of code_name_2."
  }
}


---

### Instructions for Applying Changes
Each update is written as a separate paragraph and follow these formats:  

- **Change**: Specify the operation as "Change" and include the code name. Provide a list of necessary changes in this format:  
   [change1, change2, change3]  
   Example:  
   Change: "code_name_1". Updates: [clarify benefits, remove ambiguity].  

- **Delete**: Specify the operation as "Delete" and include the code name. Provide the reason for deletion in this format:  
   [reason for deletion]  
   Example:  
   Delete: "code_name_3". Reason: [redundant with code_name_2].  

- **Add**: Specify the operation as "Add" and include a new code name. Provide the description using relevant keywords in this format:  
   [keyword1, keyword2, keyword3]  
   Example:  
   Add: "code_name_4". Keywords: [safety, trust, autonomy].

---

### Necessary Changes

- Change: "physical harm". Updates: [add arguments for unpredictable or unintended reactions from socially assistive robots; condense the description to focus on the main arguments, removing unnecessary details and the literal quote ("\n\n*** \n\n") for clarity and conciseness].


- Delete: "not insightful". Reason: [not relevant for "perceived risks"].
- Delete: "error". Reason: [not relevant for "perceived risks"].
- Delete: "data security risk". Reason: [same as "data security"].


- Add: "data security". Keywords: [concerns regarding the potential for data breaches, loss, or misuse, highlighting perceived risks to privacy and security].
- Add: "environmental vulnerabilities". Keywords: [concerns about how external factors, such as power outages, extreme temperatures, or unsuitable environments, could impair robot functionality and compromise safety or reliability].

### For the following data:

        "code_descriptions": {
            "data security risk": "Identifies concerns expressed by participants regarding the potential for data breaches or loss when interacting with socially assistive robots, highlighting perceived risks to privacy and security.",
            "physical harm": "Identifies instances where participants express concerns about the potential for physically harmful outcomes due to malfunctioning socially assistive robots. \n\n*** \n\nThis code captures instances where participants discuss the risks associated with socially assistive robots potentially causing physical harm to humans.",
            "technical issues": "Identifies instances where participants express concerns or frustrations related to malfunctions, glitches, or limitations in the technical performance of socially assistive robots, highlighting potential disruptions or challenges in their use.",
            "lack of regulations": "Identifies instances where participants express concerns about the absence of established guidelines or regulations surrounding socially assistive robots, particularly in relation to potential risks like data security breaches.",
            "not insightful": "Identifies instances where participants express dissatisfaction with the lack of depth or meaningful content in interactions with socially assistive robots, potentially hindering the perceived benefits of these interactions. \n\n*** \n\nParticipants mentioned that the interactions with the robots lacked depth and were not insightful, leading to a sense of disconnection.",
            "error": "Captures instances where participants highlight concerns or frustrations related to errors made by socially assistive robots in their interactions. \n\n*** \n\nMachines make brutal mistakes."
        }
    }

Only return the JSON file "code_descriptions" with all the necessary changes applied. Return nothing else.
