### Task Overview
Your task is to update an existing coding guideline represented as a JSON object. Each key in the object corresponds to a specific code, and its value describes that code. You will perform one or more of the following operations: modifying descriptions, removing irrelevant codes, or adding new ones.

---

### Background Information
This coding guideline is part of a research project exploring people's perceptions of robots. Participants evaluated two types of robots: **traditional rigid robots** and **soft, electronic-free robots**. Feedback was collected using scenario-based descriptions of these robots, focusing on their **perceived risks** and **benefits**. The codes in this guideline address the **perceived risks** specifically regarding **rescue robots**.

---

### Available Operations
- **Change**: Revise the description of an existing code for clarity, accuracy, or to reflect updated definitions.  
- **Delete**: Remove codes that are redundant, irrelevant, or no longer applicable.  
- **Add**: Introduce new codes to capture additional themes or concepts.  

---

### Data Structure
The guideline is structured as a JSON object under the key `code_descriptions`. Each key represents a code, and its value is a description of that code. Example structure:  
```json
{
  "code_descriptions": {
    "code_name_1": "Description of code_name_1.",
    "code_name_2": "Description of code_name_2."
  }
}
```

---

### Instructions for Applying Changes
Each update is written as a separate paragraph and follow these formats:  

- **Change**: Specify the operation as "Change" and include the code name. Provide a list of necessary changes in this format:  
   `[change1, change2, change3]`  
   Example:  
   `Change: "code_name_1". Updates: [clarify benefits, remove ambiguity].`  

- **Delete**: Specify the operation as "Delete" and include the code name. Provide the reason for deletion in this format:  
   `[reason for deletion]`  
   Example:  
   `Delete: "code_name_3". Reason: [redundant with code_name_2].`  

- **Add**: Specify the operation as "Add" and include a new code name. Provide the description using relevant keywords in this format:  
   `[keyword1, keyword2, keyword3]`  
   Example:  
   `Add: "code_name_4". Keywords: [safety, trust, autonomy].`

### Necessary Changes

- Delete: "not insightful". Reason: [not a meaningful code.].  

- Change: "technical limitation". Updates: [Condense the description to focus on the main arguments, removing unnecessary details and the literal quote ("\n\n***") for clarity and conciseness.].
- Change: "potential harm to victims". Updates: [Condense the description to focus on the main arguments, removing unnecessary details and the literal quote ("\n\n***") for clarity and conciseness.].
- Change: "Error development". Updates: [Condense the description to focus on the main arguments, removing unnecessary details and the literal quote ("\n\n***") for clarity and conciseness.].
- Change: "misidentification". Updates: [Condense the description to focus on the main arguments, removing unnecessary details and the literal quote ("\n\n***") for clarity and conciseness.].

- Change: "reliability". Updates: [Condense the description to focus on the main arguments, removing unnecessary details and the literal quote ("\n\n***") for clarity and conciseness; remove the coded texts passage].


- Change: "durability". Updates: [add concerns about material and production defects].
- Change: "technical limitation". Updates: [add issues with limited senses, orientation and navigation; remove specific references to soft materials or designs].
- Change: "misidentification". Updates: [incorporate sensor issues and scenarios where sensors fail to detect victims accurately].
- Change: "safety". Updates: [add concerns about endangerment of human lives].
- Change: "reliability". Updates: [broaden to address loss of control, highlighting situations where autonomous systems fail to behave predictably, and the potential for software errors leading to critical failures].
- Change: "potential risk". Updates: [add cyber attacks].
- Change: "Error Development". Updates: [add issues related to error detection and program disturbances].
- Change: "unintended actions". Updates: [add absence of moral decision-making].

- Add: "design limitation". Keywords: [address physical and structural considerations, such as weaknesses in soft robots or design flaws impacting resilience and performance].
