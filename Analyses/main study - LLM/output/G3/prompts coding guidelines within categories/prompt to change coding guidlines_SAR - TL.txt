### Task Overview
Your task is to update an existing coding guideline represented as a JSON object. Each key in the object corresponds to a specific code, and its value describes that code. You will perform one or more of the following operations: modifying descriptions, removing irrelevant codes, or adding new ones.

---

### Background Information
This coding guideline is part of a research project exploring people's perceptions of robots. Participants evaluated two types of robots: **traditional rigid robots** and **soft, electronic-free robots**. Feedback was collected using scenario-based descriptions of these robots, focusing on their **perceived risks** and **benefits**. The codes in this guideline address the **perceived technological limitations** specifically regarding **socially assistive robots**.

---

### Available Operations
- **Change**: Revise the description of an existing code for clarity, accuracy, or to reflect updated definitions.  
- **Delete**: Remove codes that are redundant, irrelevant, or no longer applicable.  
- **Add**: Introduce new codes to capture additional themes or concepts.  

---

### Data Structure
The guideline is structured as a JSON object under the key code_descriptions. Each key represents a code, and its value is a description of that code. Example structure:  
json
{
  "code_descriptions": {
    "code_name_1": "Description of code_name_1.",
    "code_name_2": "Description of code_name_2."
  }
}


---

### Instructions for Applying Changes
Each update is written as a separate paragraph and follow these formats:  

- **Change**: Specify the operation as "Change" and include the code name. Provide a list of necessary changes in this format:  
   [change1, change2, change3]  
   Example:  
   Change: "code_name_1". Updates: [clarify benefits, remove ambiguity].  

- **Delete**: Specify the operation as "Delete" and include the code name. Provide the reason for deletion in this format:  
   [reason for deletion]  
   Example:  
   Delete: "code_name_3". Reason: [redundant with code_name_2].  

- **Add**: Specify the operation as "Add" and include a new code name. Provide the description using relevant keywords in this format:  
   [keyword1, keyword2, keyword3]  
   Example:  
   Add: "code_name_4". Keywords: [safety, trust, autonomy].

---

### Necessary Changes

- Change: "interaction". Updates: [add argument that robots might have limited interaction capabilities due to technological limitaions].
- Change: "lower adaptability". Updates: [condense the description to focus on the main arguments, removing unnecessary details and the literal quote ("\n\n*** \n\n") for clarity and conciseness].
- Change: "limited assistance". Updates: [condense the description to focus on the main arguments, removing unnecessary details and the literal quote ("\n\n*** \n\n") for clarity and conciseness].



- Delete: "risk". Reason: [same as "lower adaptability"].
- Delete: "dialect". Reason: [same as "language barrier"].
- Delete: "prone to errors". Reason: [not relevant for "perceived technological limitations"].
- Delete: "technical progress". Reason: [same as "understanding human emotions"].
- Delete: "safety concerns". Reason: [same as "understanding human emotions"].

- Add: "language barrier". Keywords: [concerns about socially assistive robots' inability to comprehend regional or individual speech patterns, including challenges faced by individuals with age-related communication difficulties].
- Add: "understanding human emotions". Keywords: [skepticism about the current capabilities of socially assistive robots in understanding and mimicking human emotions].
- Add: "spontaneity". Keywords: [concerns about the robot's inability to handle spontaneous or unexpected situations that it hasn't been specifically trained for].

### For the following data:

"code_descriptions": {
            "risk": "Identifies concerns and potential negative outcomes associated with the use of socially assistive robots, highlighting the risks and potential harm in human-robot interactions.",
            "interaction": "Identifies concerns related to the potential negative outcomes or issues that may arise from interactions between humans and socially assistive robots, highlighting the importance of ensuring safe and beneficial interactions in the context of technological limitations.",
            "lower adaptability": "Identifies instances where participants express concerns about the restricted ability to personalize or modify socially assistive robots to suit individual needs or preferences. \n\n*** \n\nmay not be able to adjust to different environments or user preferences*** \n\nlimited flexibility in adapting to changing user requirements***",
            "limited assistance": "Denotes instances where participants express concerns about socially assistive robots being able to offer only restricted support, particularly in urgent or critical scenarios. \n\n*** \n\nPlease let me know if you need further assistance with your qualitative research project.",
            "dialect": "Identifies instances where participants express concerns about socially assistive robots' inability to comprehend regional or individual speech patterns, including challenges faced by individuals with age-related communication difficulties.",
            "prone to errors": "Identifies instances where participants compare the error-prone nature of humans to the perceived reliability of artificial helpers in the context of socially assistive robots.",
            "technical progress": "Identifies instances where participants express skepticism about the current capabilities of socially assistive robots in understanding and mimicking human emotions, highlighting concerns about the limitations of technological progress in this area.",
            "safety concerns": "Identifies concerns expressed about the current limitations in technology's ability to accurately perceive and respond to human emotions through socially assistive robots. \n\n*** \n\nParticipants express doubts about the readiness of technology to effectively recognize and respond to human emotions in socially assistive robots, citing potential safety concerns."
