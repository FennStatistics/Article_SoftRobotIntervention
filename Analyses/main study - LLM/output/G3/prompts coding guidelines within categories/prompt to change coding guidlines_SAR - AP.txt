### Task Overview
Your task is to update an existing coding guideline represented as a JSON object. Each key in the object corresponds to a specific code, and its value describes that code. You will perform one or more of the following operations: modifying descriptions, removing irrelevant codes, or adding new ones.

### Background Information
This coding guideline is part of a research project exploring people's perceptions of robots. Participants evaluated two types of robots: **traditional rigid robots** and **soft, electronic-free robots**. Feedback was collected using scenario-based descriptions of these robots, focusing on their **perceived risks** and **benefits**. The codes in this guideline address the **perceived positive anthropomorphism** specifically regarding **socially assistive robots**.

---

### Available Operations
- **Change**: Revise the description of an existing code for clarity, accuracy, or to reflect updated definitions.  
- **Delete**: Remove codes that are redundant, irrelevant, or no longer applicable.  
- **Add**: Introduce new codes to capture additional themes or concepts.  

---

### Data Structure
The guideline is structured as a JSON object under the key code_descriptions. Each key represents a code, and its value is a description of that code. Example structure:  
json
{
  "code_descriptions": {
    "code_name_1": "Description of code_name_1.",
    "code_name_2": "Description of code_name_2."
  }
}

### Instructions for Applying Changes
Each update is written as a separate paragraph and follow these formats:  

- **Change**: Specify the operation as "Change" and include the code name. Provide a list of necessary changes in this format:  
   [change1, change2, change3]  
   Example:  
   Change: "code_name_1". Updates: [clarify benefits, remove ambiguity].  

- **Delete**: Specify the operation as "Delete" and include the code name. Provide the reason for deletion in this format:  
   [reason for deletion]  
   Example:  
   Delete: "code_name_3". Reason: [redundant with code_name_2].  

- **Add**: Specify the operation as "Add" and include a new code name. Provide the description using relevant keywords in this format:  
   [keyword1, keyword2, keyword3]  
   Example:  
   Add: "code_name_4". Keywords: [safety, trust, autonomy].

### Necessary Changes

- Change: "feeling of empathy". Updates: [add arguments of lifelike characteristics as a factor enhancing perceived empathy; condense the description to focus on the main arguments, removing unnecessary details and the literal quote ("\n\n*** \n\n") for clarity and conciseness].  
- Change: "engagement". Updates: [condense the description to focus on the main arguments, removing unnecessary details and the literal quote ("\n\n*** \n\n") for clarity and conciseness].  
- Change: "material". Updates: [include the idea of soft, relatable materials (e.g., silicone) fostering physical affection; condense the description to focus on the main arguments, removing unnecessary details and the literal quote ("\n\n*** \n\n") for clarity and conciseness].  
 

- Delete: "potential benefits". Reason: [same as "emotional support"].
- Delete: "not insightful". Reason: [not relevant for the category "perceived positive anthropomorphism"].
- Delete: "user experience". Reason: [same as "calmness"].

- Add: "therapeutic applications". Keywords: [beneficial for trauma or emotionally vulnerable individuals].

### For the following data:

        "code_descriptions": {
            "potential benefit": "Identifies instances where participants discuss the possible advantages or advantages that socially assistive robots could offer in terms of emotional support or well-being. \n\nCODED TEXTS SEPARATED BY \"***\":\nEmotional support: The potential benefit of socially assistive robots lies in their ability to provide emotional support to individuals in need.***",
            "not insightful": "Identifies instances where participants express a lack of depth or meaningful engagement in interactions with socially assistive robots, suggesting a desire for more profound or thought-provoking interactions. \n\n*** \n\nThis code captures instances where participants perceive socially assistive robots as lacking in providing meaningful insights or engaging interactions, potentially indicating a desire for more intellectually stimulating interactions with AI.",
            "feeling of empathy": "Identifies instances where participants perceive socially assistive robots as displaying a heightened sense of empathy compared to other robots or entities. \n\n*** \n\nThe participants noted that the feeling of empathy from the soft robot appears greater than expected, enhancing their overall interaction experience.",
            "engagement": "Identifies instances where participants describe active involvement or interaction with socially assistive robots, highlighting engagement through physical or interactive participation. \n\n*** \n\nif the robot responds promptly to user input, it enhances engagement and fosters a sense of connection.",
            "material": "Identifies instances where participants express a preference for socially assistive robots with a tangible, material presence over those perceived as cold or impersonal. \n\n*** \n\nThe material components of the robot make it more relatable and approachable, enhancing the user's ability to connect with it on a personal level.",
            "connection": "Captures instances where participants express the ease of forming a relational connection with socially assistive robots, highlighting the perceived importance of robot design materials in facilitating human-robot connections.",
            "emotional support": "Captures instances where participants attribute emotional support qualities to socially assistive robots, viewing them as friends or listeners that aid in coping with thoughts and feelings.",
            "calmness": "Captures instances where participants highlight the calming effect of socially assistive robots, emphasizing their ability to maintain a peaceful and stable demeanor even in challenging situations.",
            "user experience": "Captures instances where participants highlight the positive aspects of interacting with socially assistive robots, emphasizing the calming effect of the robots' consistent and non-reactive demeanor."
        }
