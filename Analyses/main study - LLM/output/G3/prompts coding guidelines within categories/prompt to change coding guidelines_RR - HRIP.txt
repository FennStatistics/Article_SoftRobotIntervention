### Task Overview
Your task is to update an existing coding guideline represented as a JSON object. Each key in the object corresponds to a specific code, and its value describes that code. You will perform one or more of the following operations: modifying descriptions, removing irrelevant codes, or adding new ones.

### Background Information
This coding guideline is part of a research project exploring people's perceptions of robots. Participants evaluated two types of robots: **traditional rigid robots** and **soft, electronic-free robots**. Feedback was collected using scenario-based descriptions of these robots, focusing on their **perceived risks** and **benefits**. The codes in this guideline address the **perceived positive Human-Robot-Interaction** specifically regarding **rescue robots**.

### Available Operations
- **Change**: Revise the description of an existing code for clarity, accuracy, or to reflect updated definitions.  
- **Delete**: Remove codes that are redundant, irrelevant, or no longer applicable.  
- **Add**: Introduce new codes to capture additional themes or concepts.  

---

### Data Structure
The guideline is structured as a JSON object under the key `code_descriptions`. Each key represents a code, and its value is a description of that code. Example structure:  
```json
{
  "code_descriptions": {
    "code_name_1": "Description of code_name_1.",
    "code_name_2": "Description of code_name_2."
  }
}
```

### Instructions for Applying Changes
Each update is written as a separate paragraph and follow these formats:  

- **Change**: Specify the operation as "Change" and include the code name. Provide a list of necessary changes in this format:  
   `[change1, change2, change3]`  
   Example:  
   `Change: "code_name_1". Updates: [clarify benefits, remove ambiguity].`  

- **Delete**: Specify the operation as "Delete" and include the code name. Provide the reason for deletion in this format:  
   `[reason for deletion]`  
   Example:  
   `Delete: "code_name_3". Reason: [redundant with code_name_2].`  

- **Add**: Specify the operation as "Add" and include a new code name. Provide the description using relevant keywords in this format:  
   `[keyword1, keyword2, keyword3]`  
   Example:  
   `Add: "code_name_4". Keywords: [safety, trust, autonomy].`

### Necessary Changes

- Change: "hope". Updates: [focus solely on emotional reassurance and optimism, not the robot’s specific actions or roles].
- Change: "comfort". Updates: [focus on emotional reassurance through the robot’ (soft) design or demeanor; add instances where participants mention the adaptability of robots due to their flexible designs or forms].


- Change: "endurance". Updates: [Condense the description to focus on the main arguments, removing unnecessary details and the literal quote ("\n\n***") for clarity and conciseness.].
- Change: "complementary role". Updates: [Condense the description to focus on the main arguments, removing unnecessary details and the literal quote ("\n\n***") for clarity and conciseness.].

- Change: "endurance". Updates: [highlights physical and mental stamina in human-robot interaction rather than emotional states].
- Change: "complementary role". Updates: [add instances where robots provide tangible support in rescue scenarios, including the delivery of essential resources].

- Change: "comfort". Updates: [incorporate all the arguments of "hope", write a concise argument].
- Delete: "hope". Reason: [same as "comfort"].

### For the following data:

        "code_descriptions": {
            "hope": "Captures instances where participants express the belief that rescue robots provide hope to victims by potentially facilitating their rescue.",
            "endurance": "Captures instances where participants discuss the effects of prolonged physical or mental strain on their ability to sustain performance or functionality in the context of Human-Robot-Interaction with rescue robots. \n\n*** \n\nThis code may be applied to instances where participants mention the challenges or limitations they face in maintaining their physical or mental stamina during interactions with rescue robots, shedding light on the importance of endurance in the context of Human-Robot-Interaction.",
            "complementary role": "Identifies instances where participants highlight the supportive and enhancing role of rescue robots in complementing human actions and tasks within the context of Human-Robot-Interaction in rescue scenarios. \n\n*** \n\nenhances human capabilities through collaboration with robots***\n\n*** \n\nrobots are seen as assisting and supporting rather than replacing human efforts",
            "comfort": "Captures instances where the non-mechanical appearance of rescue robots provides a sense of calm and reassurance to victims in distress."
        }
