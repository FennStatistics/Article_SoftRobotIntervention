### Task Overview
Your task is to update an existing coding guideline represented as a JSON object. Each key in the object corresponds to a specific code, and its value describes that code. You will perform one or more of the following operations: modifying descriptions, removing irrelevant codes, or adding new ones.

### Background Information
This coding guideline is part of a research project exploring people's perceptions of robots. Participants evaluated two types of robots: **traditional rigid robots** and **soft, electronic-free robots**. Feedback was collected using scenario-based descriptions of these robots, focusing on their **perceived risks** and **benefits**. The codes in this guideline address the **perceived positive anthropomorphism** specifically regarding **rescue robots**.

### Available Operations
- **Change**: Revise the description of an existing code for clarity, accuracy, or to reflect updated definitions.  
- **Delete**: Remove codes that are redundant, irrelevant, or no longer applicable.  
- **Add**: Introduce new codes to capture additional themes or concepts.  

---

### Data Structure
The guideline is structured as a JSON object under the key `code_descriptions`. Each key represents a code, and its value is a description of that code. Example structure:  
```json
{
  "code_descriptions": {
    "code_name_1": "Description of code_name_1.",
    "code_name_2": "Description of code_name_2."
  }
}
```

### Instructions for Applying Changes
Each update is written as a separate paragraph and follow these formats:  

- **Change**: Specify the operation as "Change" and include the code name. Provide a list of necessary changes in this format:  
   `[change1, change2, change3]`  
   Example:  
   `Change: "code_name_1". Updates: [clarify benefits, remove ambiguity].`  

- **Delete**: Specify the operation as "Delete" and include the code name. Provide the reason for deletion in this format:  
   `[reason for deletion]`  
   Example:  
   `Delete: "code_name_3". Reason: [redundant with code_name_2].`  

- **Add**: Specify the operation as "Add" and include a new code name. Provide the description using relevant keywords in this format:  
   `[keyword1, keyword2, keyword3]`  
   Example:  
   `Add: "code_name_4". Keywords: [safety, trust, autonomy].`

### Necessary Changes

- Change: "lack of emotionality". Updates: [focus on how robots can handle emotionally charged situations differently from humans, rewrite the text that lack of emotionality is seen as something positive].

- Add: "Human-like design". Keywords: [incoporate all the arguments of "interaction design", highlighting that robots designed with qualities that feel human-like or natural, promoting emotional engagement and familiarity].  
- Delete: "interaction design". Reason: [same as "lack of empathy"].  

- Change: "lack of emotionality". Updates: [Condense the description to focus on the main arguments, removing unnecessary details and the literal quote ("\n\n***") for clarity and conciseness.].
- Change: "efficiency". Updates: [Condense the description to focus on the main arguments, removing unnecessary details and the literal quote ("\n\n***") for clarity and conciseness.].

### For the following data:

        "code_descriptions": {
            "interaction design": "Identifies instances where participants express a desire for rescue robots to exhibit human-like qualities in their design, emphasizing the importance of creating emotionally engaging interactions.",
            "lack of emotionality": "Identifies instances where participants express concerns about the perceived absence of emotional depth or empathy in rescue robots compared to human rescuers, highlighting potential limitations in emotional support and understanding. \n\n*** \n\nRobots lack the ability to provide emotional comfort or understanding in distressing situations, which could be a significant drawback in rescue scenarios where human empathy is valued.",
            "efficiency": "Identifies instances where participants highlight the improved operational effectiveness and productivity achieved through the autonomous functioning of robots in the context of the perceived positive anthropomorphism of rescue robots. \n\n***Robots operate automatically and can therefore trade more efficiently***",
            "autonomous decisions": "Identifies instances where participants discuss the potential advantages of rescue robots making autonomous decisions, emphasizing the perceived benefits of logic over human emotions and biases in critical situations."
        }

Only return the JSON file "code_descriptions" with all the necessary changes applied. Return nothing else.
