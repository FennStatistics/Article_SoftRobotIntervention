### Task Overview
Your task is to update an existing coding guideline represented as a JSON object. Each key in the object corresponds to a specific code, and its value describes that code. You will perform one or more of the following operations: modifying descriptions, removing irrelevant codes, or adding new ones.

### Background Information
This coding guideline is part of a research project exploring people's perceptions of robots. Participants evaluated two types of robots: **traditional rigid robots** and **soft, electronic-free robots**. Feedback was collected using scenario-based descriptions of these robots, focusing on their **perceived risks** and **benefits**. The codes in this guideline address the **perceived technological possibilities** specifically regarding **rescue robots**.

### Available Operations
- **Change**: Revise the description of an existing code for clarity, accuracy, or to reflect updated definitions.  
- **Delete**: Remove codes that are redundant, irrelevant, or no longer applicable.  
- **Add**: Introduce new codes to capture additional themes or concepts.  

---

### Data Structure
The guideline is structured as a JSON object under the key `code_descriptions`. Each key represents a code, and its value is a description of that code. Example structure:  
```json
{
  "code_descriptions": {
    "code_name_1": "Description of code_name_1.",
    "code_name_2": "Description of code_name_2."
  }
}
```

### Instructions for Applying Changes
Each update is written as a separate paragraph and follow these formats:  

- **Change**: Specify the operation as "Change" and include the code name. Provide a list of necessary changes in this format:  
   `[change1, change2, change3]`  
   Example:  
   `Change: "code_name_1". Updates: [clarify benefits, remove ambiguity].`  

- **Delete**: Specify the operation as "Delete" and include the code name. Provide the reason for deletion in this format:  
   `[reason for deletion]`  
   Example:  
   `Delete: "code_name_3". Reason: [redundant with code_name_2].`  

- **Add**: Specify the operation as "Add" and include a new code name. Provide the description using relevant keywords in this format:  
   `[keyword1, keyword2, keyword3]`  
   Example:  
   `Add: "code_name_4". Keywords: [safety, trust, autonomy].`
