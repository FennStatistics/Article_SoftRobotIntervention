    "emotions": "Incorporated references to fear and discomfort caused by emotionally detached robots in rescue scenarios."
    "lack of emotional understanding": "Broadened the description to include concerns about the robot's inability to recognize distress, fear, or pain, alongside compassion and empathy; condensed the description for clarity and merged relevant arguments from 'lack of emotional connection'."

Delete:

    "lack of emotional connection": "Removed because its content was similar to 'lack of emotional understanding,' which has now been updated to encompass these ideas."
