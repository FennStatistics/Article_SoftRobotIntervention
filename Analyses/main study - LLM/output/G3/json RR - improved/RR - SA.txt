Change:

    "strength": "Expanded description to include specific examples of physical superiority, such as lifting heavy objects and navigating difficult terrains."
    "reliability": "Enhanced the definition to include consistent performance, precise control, and the role of rescue robots in reducing risks in hazardous conditions."
    "replaceability": "Refined the description to emphasize that material loss is less significant than human loss and the ease of substituting robots in operations."
    "efficiency": "Incorporated arguments of speed and operational efficiency to highlight quicker response times, improved performance, and reduced risks during interventions."
    "access": "Condensed the description to focus on enhanced access to remote or hard-to-reach areas, enabling quicker responses and potential lifesaving actions."
    "focus on task": "Clarified the emphasis on task efficiency and the lack of emotional interference, enhancing reliability in rescue missions."
    "search capabilities": "Condensed the description to emphasize the advanced sensor technology and its utility in challenging environments like dark or smoky areas."

Delete:

    "safety": "Removed for being a generic argument with limited utility in the context of the guidelines."
    "benefit": "Eliminated for being overly broad and not directly relevant."
    "speed": "Removed due to redundancy with the more comprehensive 'efficiency' code."
    "operational efficiency": "Deleted as its arguments were merged into the updated 'efficiency' code."
    "not insightful": "Deleted for lacking meaningful or actionable content."
    "": "Removed because the code name was missing and lacked meaningful context."

Add:

    No new codes were added in this update.

Renamed manually the following four categories:
    efficiency -> Operational Efficiency
