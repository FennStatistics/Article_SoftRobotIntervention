Change:

    "technological limitations": "Condensed the description for clarity and conciseness, but later removed due to its broad scope (see Delete section)."
    "movement": "Condensed the description to focus on restricted mobility concerns in emergency situations."
    "specialization": "Revised to include the limitation of robots' adaptability to diverse rescue scenarios."
    "operational mechanism": "Condensed the description to focus on underlying algorithm functionality."
    "limited autonomy": "Condensed and focused on challenges in responding to dynamic and unpredictable circumstances."
    "faulty analyses": "Condensed the description and added the importance of human oversight to prevent errors."
    "speed comparison": "Condensed the description to focus on concerns about robots' speed compared to humans in emergencies."
    "damage not excludable": "Condensed the description and added concerns about soft/non-durable materials being damaged quickly."
    "operational delay": "Incorporated battery life and recharging issues into the description."
    "robot runtime": "Added concerns about energy constraints affecting operational duration."
    "error risk": "Incorporated arguments from 'error-free,' noting errors can arise from software, hardware, and algorithms."

Delete:

    "not insightful": "Removed for being not meaningful as a code."
    "error-free": "Deleted as it was redundant with 'error risk.'"
    "technological limitations": "Deleted for being overly broad."
    "perceived technological limitations": "Deleted for being overly broad and redundant."

Add:

    "immature technology": "Highlights the developmental limitations of rescue robot technology, focusing on the lack of readiness for real-world application."
    "limited flexibility": "Describes the inability of rescue robots to adapt dynamically to unforeseen or complex situations."
