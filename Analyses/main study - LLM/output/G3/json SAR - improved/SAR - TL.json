    "interaction": "Identifies concerns related to the potential negative outcomes or issues that may arise from interactions between humans and socially assistive robots, highlighting the importance of ensuring safe and beneficial interactions in the context of technological limitations. This includes the possibility that robots might have limited interaction capabilities due to technological limitations.",
