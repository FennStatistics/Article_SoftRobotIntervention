Initially, they listed their perceived risks and benefits of rigid robots in a list titled \"rigid.\" Subsequently, they learned about the trend towards soft robots, which are made of flexible, soft materials and are electronic-free.

Additionally, provide a summary paragraph of no more than four sentences that encapsulates the main findings and the found differences. Do not use the term list, instead refer to the {robots}.
